7.2 Online Exam Scoring


Algorithm:

1. Input student answers and correct answers.

2. Initialize score = 0.

3. For each answer pair (s, c): if s == c, increment score by 1.

4. Calculate percentage = (score / total_questions) * 100.

5. Output score and percentage.

Code:
def exam_score(student_answers, correct_answers):
    score = 0
    for s, c in zip(student_answers, correct_answers):
        if s == c:
            score += 1
    percentage = (score / len(correct_answers)) * 100
    return score, percentage

student = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A']
answer_key = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B']
print(exam_score(student, answer_key))  # Output: (3, 60.0)
